1.  Introduction
   
   The purpose of the project R-Type is to create a multiplayer online
   game engine and running an existing game name R-Type release in 1987

//   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
//   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
//   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  R-Type architecture

   The architecture of this project is a classic client-server game
   architecture.
   ??Each game engine can be server or client. A client connect to a server
   ??by configuring his configuration file.
   Multiple clients can connect to the server at the same time.

3.  R-Type TCP Protocol

   3a.  Payload

      Every transmission MUST transmit a payload containing this 4 datas:

         u_int64_t TimeStamp (since the Epoch see https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16);
         u_int64_t Entity_ID;
         Event event;
         u_int64_t nbComp;

      Where TimeStamp is the time reference since the Epoch base on the
      year 1970 see:
      https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap04.html#tag_04_16

      The Entity_ID is the ID given to an Entity that will be use for the
      gameEngine.

      The Event enumeration:

         enum Event : int {
            New,
            Edit,
            Delete
         };
      
      The nbComp is the number of Component the Entity_ID is composed 

      To send a payload, each data MUST be written on the UDP socket in
      this order: TimeStamp, Entity_ID, Event, nbComp.

   3b.  Server connection

      To connect to the server, the client MUST send to the server a
      payload containing:

         ACTION_NAME = CONNECT
         BODY_SIZE = PLAYER_NAME's length
         BODY = PLAYER_NAME (chosen by the client's user)

      On success, the server MUST send to the client a response payload
      containing:

         ACTION_NAME = OK

         The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
	 containing additionnal informations.

      On failure, the server MUST send to the client a response payload
      containing:

         ACTION_NAME = KO

         The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
         containing additionnal informations about the failure.

   3c.  Lobby connection

      Once connected to the server, the client can connect to a lobby.
      The client can (as described in details below) create a new lobby,
      list the existing lobbies or join an already created lobby.

      To create a new game lobby, the client MUST send to the server a
      payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = CREATE
            BODY_SIZE = LOBBY_NAME's length
            BODY = LOBBY_NAME (chosen by the client's user)

         On success, the server MUST send to the client a response
         payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = OK

            The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
            containing additionnal informations.

         On failure, the server MUST send to the client a response
         payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = KO

            The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
            containing additionnal informations about the failure.

RFC 0001                    R-Type Protocols                 Janvier 2024


      To list existing game lobbies, the client MUST send to the server
      a payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = LIST

         On success, the server MUST send to the client a response
         payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = OK
            BODY_SIZE = LOBBIES's length
            BODY = LOBBIES_INFO

            Where LOBBIES_INFO is a list of LOBBY_INFO separated by
            a ';' character (ASCII: 0x3B)
            LOBBY_INFO is the name of the lobby and its current number
            of players separated by a ',' character (ASCII: 0x2C)

            Example:

                  /--------------------------------------\
                  |    lobby name    | Number of players |
                  |------------------|-------------------|
                  |    lobby_01      |         2         |
                  |    nice_lobby    |         1         |
                  |    LobbyRType    |         4         |
                  \--------------------------------------/

            LOBBIES_INFO = "lobby_01,2;nice_lobby,1;LobbyRType,4"

         On failure, the server MUST send to the client a response
         payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = KO

            The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
            containing additionnal informations about the failure.

      To join an already existing game lobby, the client MUST send to
      the server a payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = JOIN
            BODY_SIZE = LOBBY_NAME's length
            BODY = LOBBY_NAME (the name of the lobby to join)

RFC 0001                    R-Type Protocols                 Janvier 2024


         On success, the server MUST respond to the client who joined
         with a payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = OK
            BODY_SIZE = PLAYER_NAMES's length
            BODY = PLAYER_NAMES

            Where PLAYER_NAMES is a list of the names of the players
            already connected to the joined lobby, separated by a ';'
            character (ASCII: 0x3B)

            In addition, on success the server MUST say to the other
            clients connected to the lobby that a new player joined
            them. Thus the server MUST send to every other clients
            connected to the lobby a payload containing:

               ACTION_NAME = JOINED
               BODY_SIZE = PLAYER_NAME's length
               BODY = PLAYER_NAME (the name of the new player)


         On failure, the server MUST send to the client a response
         payload containing:

            ACTION_NAME = KO

            The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
            containing additionnal informations about the failure.

   3d.  Game start

      In order to start a game, the client MUST be in a lobby.
      It MAY NOT be the creator of the lobby. To start the game, the
      client MUST first send to the server a payload containing:

         ACTION_NAME = READY

      On success, to start the game, the server MUST send to ALL the
      clients connected to the game lobby a payload containing:

         ACTION_NAME = START

         The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
         containing additionnal informations.

      On failure, the server MUST send to the client a response
      payload containing:

         ACTION_NAME = KO

         The server MAY add a BODY data to the response payload,
         containing additionnal informations about the failure.

4.  R-Type UDP Protocol

   Once the game is launched, the client-server communications are done
   by using this R-Type UDP Protocol.

   4a.  Frames transmission

      The first purpose of the R-Type UDP Protocol is to send all the
      frames to display (in the client) from the server to the
      client.

      The payload to send MUST contain all the elements to display in a
      single frame, grouped in a SPRITE_LIST.

      A SPRITE_LIST is a succession of SPRITE.

      A SPRITE is a succession of 7 numbers representing a sprite to
      display and its position. Each one of these numbers MUST be coded
      on 4 bytes. Thus, a SPRITE MUST be 28 bytes long, and a
      SPRITE_LIST of (n) SPRITE MUST be (n * 28) bytes long.

      The SPRITE composition MUST be the following:

         1st number = the index of the sprite's spritesheet

         2nd number = X coordinate (in pixels) of the sprite's top left
                      corner in its spritesheet

         3rd number = Y coordinate (in pixels) of the sprite's top left
                      corner in its spritesheet

         4th number = the sprite's width (in pixels)

         5th number = the sprite's height (in pixels)

         6th number = X coordinate (in pixels) of the sprite's top left
                      corner in the game window

         7th number = Y coordinate (in pixels) of the sprite's top left
                      corner in the game window

   The order of the SPRITE elements in SPRITE_LIST MUST be the final
   order of displaying (in the game, every SPRITE will be displayed over
   the previous ones).

   The client MUST NOT respond to the server when a payload has been
   received.

   4b.  Player events

      The player, on the client-side, can execute several actions. On
      each player action, the client MUST send to the server a specific
      event payload containing informations about the action. This
      payload MUST begins with an element (on 4 bytes) from the EVENT
      enumeration, described below:

         enum EVENT {
            MOVE,
            SHOOT,
            QUIT
         };

         The MOVE event:

            The player wants to move (to the left, right, up or down).
            The client MUST add to the payload an element (on 4 bytes)
            of the DIRECTION enumeration (described below) right after
            the EVENT element. Thus, if the player wants to move, the
            payload MUST be 8 bytes long.

            enum DIRECTION {
               LEFT,
               RIGHT,
               UP,
               DOWN
            };

         The SHOOT event:

            The player wants to shoot. In this case, the payload MUST be
            only 4 bytes long.

         The QUIT event:

            The player wants to quit the game. The client MUST warn the
            server with this 4 bytes long payload before quitting. The
            client MAY exit without any response from the server.
